## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to **predict rainfall** based on daily weather parameters including temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and pressure. The workflow includes:

- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building (Traditional ML, Ensemble, Deep Learning)
-
